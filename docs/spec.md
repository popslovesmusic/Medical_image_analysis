# Module Specification

**Path:** docs
**Generated by:** Codex cleanup task
**Date:** 2025-10-31

Specification: Documentation Layer

Module Path: docs/
Parent Specs:

AGENTS.md (Global repository governance and ZAGs)
core/spec.md (Technical core references)
trainer/spec.md (Model and training documentation)
experiments/spec.md (Experimental log integration)

I. Mission

The Documentation Layer ensures that every component, process, and transformation in the system is transparently documented, reproducible, and auditable.

This layer connects:

📑 Specifications — design blueprints and standards.
📈 Reports — results and analyses from experimental runs.
🧭 Diagrams — process visualizations for architecture and data flow.
🧩 References — links to external sources, datasets, and regulatory compliance.

Its purpose is to maintain a living design record synchronized with the cognitive core and training subsystems — forming the “Single Source of Truth” (SSOT) for the project.

III. Documentation Categories
1. Specification Documents

Markdown (.md) files defining architecture, protocols, and module responsibilities.
All specs must include:

Version number
Determinism level
Change history
Responsible agent or maintainer

Naming convention:

phase_<N>_<module>_spec.md

2. Reports

Generated outputs summarizing:

Model validation metrics
Diagnostic test results
Core audit findings
Cross-phase performance logs

Reports are written automatically by core/diagnostics modules and stored in docs/reports/.

Naming convention:

report_<module>_<YYYYMMDD>.md

3. Diagrams

Visual documentation for architecture, data flow, tensor bridges, and diagnostic logic.
Preferred formats:

.svg (vector, editable)
.drawio (editable flow diagrams)
.png (snapshots)
.md with embedded ASCII for Git diffs

Naming convention:

<topic>_diagram.svg

IV. Specification Template (for reference)

Every .md spec must follow this standard header:

# Specification: <Title>

**Module Path:** `<relative path>`
**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** <Agent Name>
**Last Updated:** {{auto-date}}
**Determinism Level:** <Bit-Exact / Analytical / Probabilistic>

V. Synchronization & Version Control

All documentation updates are atomic and version-controlled through the following mechanisms:

Type	Description	Automation
Specs	Stored in docs/specs/, updated per phase	Auto-generated by Codex
Reports	Created after test or validation runs	Produced by diagnostics/test runners
Diagrams	Linked by SHA hash to specific commit	Auto-verified by script
Changelogs	Logged in docs/changelogs/	Auto-updated during release tagging

All updates are timestamped, and every spec or report includes a deterministic hash linking it to the source code revision (see meta/chronicle).

VI. Compliance Requirements

Each documentation artifact must meet the following standards:

Category	Standard
Format	Markdown + UTF-8
Diagram Source	Editable (no raster-only formats)
Version Tags	Semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0...)
Cross-Reference	Linked to code modules via relative paths
Accessibility	WCAG-compliant for visualizations
Automation	Must be processable by a Rust-native tool (e.g., `mdbook` or a `doc_builder` crate)

VII. Automation and Regeneration

This layer is maintained automatically through Rust-native tooling:

**`cargo run --package doc_builder`** — rebuilds specs and changelogs
**`cargo run --package diagram_generator`** — regenerates diagrams using Rust libraries
**`core/meta/chronicle.rs`** — verifies synchronization between code and spec version
**`experiments/archive/restoration/`** — Rust-based audit scripts for docs

Each document is signed by the Codex Documentation Agent with a SHA256 digest stored in:

docs/reports/compliance/doc_hash_registry.json

VIII. Determinism Policy

To ensure all documentation outputs are identical across builds:

Auto-timestamp normalization ({{auto-date}} replaced post-hash)
SHA-based file linking for diagrams and specs
Non-stochastic rendering for generated diagrams
Stable sort order in table rendering and file manifests

These guarantees ensure that the docs directory itself can serve as a cryptographic proof of project integrity.
